# Winston's Parallax Viewer

I used Three.js and Tween.js to represent a parallax angle scenario. This is solely just to demonstrate the paralllax effect. Change the distance in the simulator to view the parallax effect of having two stationary observers and one obejct that has moved further/closer. Change the observer view from 1 to 2 and back in order to see that the posiiton of the red ball in the observers screen changes.
